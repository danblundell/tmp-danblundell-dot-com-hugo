Week commencing 28th December 2020.

{{< backlink draft-post>}}

A new year and a welcome week of fewer meetings, time to think and digest, join some dots and come up with some experiments for the next few weeks.

## Life
* Recovered from Christmas madness with two very excited toddlers 🎄
* Tried to mostly avoid the news because 
* Set out my [#Gymshark66][gs-66] pledge to move every day for 30mins+ for 66 days, stick to my weeknotes consistently and be more present. [Read more about #Gymshark66][gs-66]
* Started [Year Compass][year-compass] for the fifth year in a row, it's a fair few pages to work through but I've found it really useful each year

## Work
* Going over rcruitment pipelines and applicants for some engineering roles - take a look at our [current vacancies at Gymshark][gs-vacancies]  👩‍💻
* Reviewed some great posts from [Lead Dev][leaddev] on [designing equitable hiring processes][leaddev-equitable-hiring] 🎉
* Mapped out some of the communication paths and relationships between the Tech teams in preparation 🔗
* Had a great session with some of our team getting to know more about our architecture and existing services 👁️

## Down time
* Finished [Team Topologies][team-topologies] and made _a lot_ of notes 📕
* Finally started watching The Mandolorian on Disney+ 🪐
* Caught up on my current podcast subscriptions from 2020 🎙️
* Stuck to my 'move every day' pledge thanks to [Peloton][peloton] 🚴‍♂️ (referral code: `PCSC42`)
